# Report Vulnerability Assessment  

This repository was created to demonstrate the skill of assessing and reporting vulnerabilities. This activity was
proposed during the [Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate][link1], the prompt and the layout used in this
document also came from the same source, however, the analysis and the reporting writing was done by the owner of this
repository.  

## Prompt  

In the proposed scenario, an e-commerce company requested the security team to perform a vulnerability assessment in of
their assets. The asset in question is a remote database server used by the company to store the company's data and
information about the company's customers. Since the organization went public, the server has been maintained on public
access to anyone. The system is used by the employees to perform queries, request, and gather information for multiple
purposes. Most of the employees work remotely, and the organization has staff all around the globe, so different people
from different geographic locations have access to the system daily. The report generated by this assessment will be
used to guide the decision-making process of management on how to make their assets more secure.  

## Report  

The report can be viewed under the [Vulnerability Assessment Report (eCommerce Company)][link2]
